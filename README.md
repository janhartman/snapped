# SNAPPED

## What
A tool for replacing a person's face in a collection of images with another person's face.

Point it at a collection of images, an image of the target person and an image of another person.
It will search all the images in the collection and replace all occurrences of target person's face with the other face you provided, 
thus snapping the target away with a snap of your fingers.

## Setup
```
apt install -y python3 python3-pip cmake git python3-opencv
pip3 install face-recognition numpy scipy dlib flask
